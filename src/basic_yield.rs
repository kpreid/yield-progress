/// The minimum, executor-agnostic yield operation.
/// **This may be unsuitable for some applications.**
///
/// This function is provided as a convenience for constructing a [`YieldProgress`] where no more
/// specific yield implementation is required. It does not itself interact with the
/// [`YieldProgress`] system.
///
/// # Caveat
///
/// This function implements yielding by returning a [`Future`] which will:
///
/// 1. The first time it is polled, immediately [wake] and return [`Poll::Pending`].
/// 2. The second time it is polled, return [`Poll::Ready`].
///
/// This might be inadequate if the executor's scheduling policy:
///
/// * Distinguishes intentional yielding.
///   For example, in Tokio 1.\*, you should use [`tokio::task::yield_now()`] instead.
/// * Is not fair among tasks, so some amount of delay is required to successfully yield to other
///   tasks.
/// * Is not fair between tasks and something else.
///   For example, if the executor is implemented inside some event loop but itself loops through
///   Rust async tasks as long as any of the tasks have [woken][wake], then something additional is
///   needed to yield to the higher level.
///
/// [wake]: core::task::Waker::wake()
